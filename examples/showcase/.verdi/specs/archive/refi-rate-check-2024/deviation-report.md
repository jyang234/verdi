# Alignment report: refi-rate-check-2024 (final edition)

Part of the round-four archived quartet fixture. Deliberately carries no
`accepted-deviation` disposition — this story must NOT trip the
`spec-stale` flag (that role belongs to `borrower-update-mobile`'s living
report in this overlay).

## Computed

The implements edge into `spec/loan-refi-2023#ac-1` resolves at the
closure head.
